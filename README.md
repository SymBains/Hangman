# Hangman Game

## Description
The Hangman Game is a text-based guessing game where players attempt to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. The aim of the project was to create a fun and interactive game that can be played in the terminal. Throughout the development of this project, I learned about object-oriented programming, managing game state, and handling user input in Python.
